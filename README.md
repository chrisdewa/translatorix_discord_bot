# Translatorix
Simple-is-better translator bot for discord.
##Why:
Translatorix aims to solve the issue of translating messages in an easy intuitive way.
The official version translates between spanish and english. Languages are very easily set in the code.

The aim of this project is to be adaptable and customizable while maintaining a simple-is-better user interaction.
## TO-DO (in no particular order):
- Client Side dynamic Language customization
- Setup command for clones of the repo to faclitate installation.
- Customizing the way the translation is sent to users
